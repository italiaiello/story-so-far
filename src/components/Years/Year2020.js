                        We matched on Bumble on the 8th of March, 2020, texted back and forth for an awesome 2 days, and then 
                        I added you on Facebook so that we could finally get off the app <Emoji symbol="🤪" />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We talked for about a week on messenger, and in that week, we really got to know each other super well
                        <Emoji symbol=" 😊 " />  If our texts were mountains, some of them would give Mount Everest a run for its 
                        money <Emoji symbol=" 😏" />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After that amazing week of back and forth, we went on our first date to Either Or in Newtown. That date
                        was so great (even though we got lost a couple of times <Emoji symbol="😜" />) but little did I know that we were about to
                        enter into something amazing...Quarantine Skype Calls! <Emoji symbol="😁" />

                        Because of COVID-19, our following dates had to be done over Skype. It brought
                        us closer a lot faster which became especially clear when we finally got to
                        meet up in person after a month of skyping <Emoji symbol=" 😁" /> 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I always remember being worried that I would run out of things to say during the call, but
                        somehow we just never, EVER, shut up <Emoji symbol=" 😂 " /> so in the blink of an eye we would have been talking for
                        3 hours.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Fast forward to restrictions being slowly eased, and we get to have a few more dates in person after so
                        long. It was technically only our second proper date, but like we always say, it was like we knew each other
                        for ages <Emoji symbol=" 🤗 " />

                    <p>The best date we had so far, without a doubt <Emoji symbol=" 😊" /> We spent the whole day together, and it was the first time when
                        we walked around hand-in-hand (it was such an amazing feeling <Emoji symbol=" 😉 " />). Whenever I would see you smiling at me,
                        it was like we were in our own little bubble and nothing else mattered <Emoji symbol=" 🤗" />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When it came time to grab some dinner, your idea to have a pizza picnic in the park was such an amazing idea. It's cute moments like these
                        that make me pinch myself that I'm actually spending time with someone as special as you <Emoji symbol=" 😊 " />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Another reason why it was such a special date was because it was the day we agreed to make our relationship official. I was expecting to
                        have to ask you to be my girlfriend in a more formal way <Emoji symbol=" 😂 " /> but we just ended up agreeing to it so casually, which 
                        made it so much better <Emoji symbol=" 😊 " /> It was a real testament to how comfortable we've become with each other.

                    It has always been a dream of mine to have my girlfriend watch me play soccer, and I couldn’t be prouder to have you watching on from the sideline <Emoji symbol=" 🥰 " /> It was even better that we 
                    actually won the game for your first time watching (I reckon you are definitely a lucky charm <Emoji symbol=" 😉" />)  and I think you gave me super powers during the game <Emoji symbol=" 🤗 " />

                    After all the banter and jokes we made about kicking each other’s asses, we finally had the chance to go to Holey Moley <Emoji symbol=" 🤗 " /> I was pretty surprised that it was so close the whole way through, I honestly 
                    thought that I would easily win, but you definitely showed some amazing skills <Emoji symbol=" 😏" /> 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Being super cocky got the better of me in the end, and you were just too good for me on the day. But don’t you worry, 
                    I’m gonna make things right when we go bowling <Emoji symbol=" 😉" />

                    If we lost Holey Moley, the stakes were that I had to wear my mum’s heels, and you had to wear your frog onesie with a bra on the outside <Emoji symbol=" 😂 " /> Since you kicked my ass, I had to slip into my mum’s heels (which were a surprisingly

                    Our bowling date was really fun, well for me at least <Emoji symbol=" 🤪 " /> To be honest, I was surprised at how well you did (you even developed a new amazing bowling technique <Emoji symbol=" 😂" />) but I definitely reckon we both knew who was going to win before we 
                    even started. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I think we were both happy that I won in the end anyway, considering the high stakes we were playing for. Since you won Holey Moley, you kept the forfeit of wearing your frog onesie with a bra on the outside <Emoji symbol=" 😏" /> 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My new one was that I had to maintain an expressionless face and not touch you at all for the rest of the day (which would have been horrible <Emoji symbol=" 🥰" />)
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As shown in the image, you had to transform into Bra-Frog Lady, and somehow you still look super cute. I think I need to make out with Bra-Frog Lady soon <Emoji symbol=" 😉" />

                    I never would have imagined celebrating my 21st with such an amazing girl by my side, but having you there made the day so much more special <Emoji symbol=" 🤗 " /> You just seemed to fit in to the family so well, everyone loved you instantly, and I knew they would love you cause you’re just so

                    Everything worked out perfectly too <Emoji symbol=" 😏 " /> Obviously my actual 21st was May 17th, but I reckon COVID almost acted like a wingman, cause it would have definitely been a bit early for you to meet my parents at the party if it happened in May, and we weren’t as comfortable with each other compared to now <Emoji symbol=" 😊" />

                        I never imagined that in 2020 I would be in my girlfriend's room wearing her dresses and frog onesie while posing for the camera <Emoji symbol=" 😆 " /> I don't know about you, but I reckon I look pretty sexy in them (especially the red dress and the onesie <Emoji symbol=" 😉" />)
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Then we got some food from Grill’d (bloody phenomenal burgers and chips <Emoji symbol=" 😏" />), cuddled on your bed and watched Coming to America <Emoji symbol=" 😊 " /> Having you resting on my shoulder and holding each other’s hand throughout the movie was so awesome, I wished we could just stay like that forever <Emoji symbol=" 😚" />
                        <br />
                        <br />

                    After getting my ass kicked in Holey Moley the first time, I was adamant to make up for it <Emoji symbol=" 😏 " /> So, we had another battle at the Chatswood one. I think this time around was a much better reflection of our skill levels <Emoji symbol=" 🤪 " />(that pendulum one really screwed you up <Emoji symbol=" 😂" />).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Then we played pool together and you actually weren’t as bad as you made yourself out to be. I was pretty impressed <Emoji symbol=" 😊" />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Doing the arcade is always a must, but I think we’ve agreed that we’ll never go near that dancing one again <Emoji symbol=" 😆" /> And as usual, we had our super tense air hockey battle which I really love since you look super sexy when you do a little celebratory dance after getting a point <Emoji symbol=" 😉" />

                    One of the highlights was using that photobooth <Emoji symbol=" 🤗 " /> We messed it up a little the first time, but once we got the hang of it we were amazing <Emoji symbol=" 🥰 " /> (you look super sexy in every photo <Emoji symbol=" 😏" />). And damn we’re amazing kissers <Emoji symbol=" 😚" />
